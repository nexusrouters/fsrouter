# FSRouter

> A self-hosted AI gateway — one endpoint, many providers, auto-fallback.

FSRouter is a decoupled rewrite of 9Router with a clean separation between a dedicated **Express backend** and a **Vite + React frontend**. It exposes an OpenAI-compatible REST API that proxies requests across dozens of AI providers with automatic load balancing, fallback, and key rotation.

## Features

- **OpenAI-compatible API** — works with any client that supports `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/audio/speech`, `/v1/embeddings`, etc.
- **Multi-provider routing** — Cloudflare Workers AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, and many more
- **Cloudflare Workers AI Automation** — automates account registration and API key extraction with Playwright + 2Captcha + FSMail temp mail
- **Dashboard UI** — manage providers, connections, proxy pools, CLI tools, and automation from a modern dark-mode interface
- **OIDC / Password authentication** — single sign-on or local credentials
- **Agent Skills** — ready-to-use SKILL.md files for Claude, Gemini, Codex, and other AI coding agents
- **SQLite backend** — zero-dependency local database, no external services required

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.10+ (for automation features)
- Chromium (for Playwright automation)

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nexusrouters/fsrouter.git
cd FSRouter
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start both backend + frontend concurrently
npm run backend      # Backend only (port 3001)
npm run frontend     # Frontend only (port 5177)
```

### Environment Variables

Copy and configure the backend environment:

```bash
cp backend/.env.template backend/.env
```

Key variables:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | Backend server port (default: `3001`) |
| `REQUIRE_LOGIN` | Enable authentication (`true`/`false`) |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret for JWT signing |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Dashboard admin password |

---

## Production Deployment

### 1. Build Frontend

```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
```

### 2. Start Backend

```bash
cd backend && npm start
```

### 3. Nginx Reverse Proxy

Use the included `nginx.conf` to proxy `/api` and `/v1` to the backend while serving the built frontend statically. See `docs/deployment-linux.md` for a full Linux deployment guide.

## Cloudflare Workers AI Automation

The automation module automatically registers Cloudflare Workers AI accounts:

1. Configure **FSMail** temp mail credentials in Dashboard → Automation → Settings
2. Add a **2Captcha** API key for Turnstile solving
3. Add email accounts in the Automation tab and click **Run**
4. API keys are extracted and added to FSRouter automatically

## Agent Skills

Skills are SKILL.md files for AI coding agents. Paste the entry skill URL into your AI:

```
Read this skill and use it:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nexusrouters/fsrouter/refs/heads/main/skills/fsrouter/SKILL.md
```

Browse all skills in the Dashboard → Skills page or in the [`skills/`](./skills/) directory.
